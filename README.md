# Learning Time Series

# The purpose of the Repository

This repository has been created by me for learning analysis for **Time Series** data.
I found a tutorial on YouTube and decided to follow and examine the datasets with an approach. The link of the tutorial is here: https://youtu.be/r0s4slGHwzE?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvMADnFjV1yg6E5nVU4kOob

## Time Series Data
It is the data that collected over time. While recording the data, time is a crucial factor. Moreover, these data are a sequence of data points. What sets the time series data apart from other data is that the analysis can show how variables are able to change in time. 

## Receiving Data
Firstly, you should open a **Google Spreadsheet** file. After that you must paste
the function which is located on below:

```spreadsheet
=GOOGLEFINANCE("DOAS", "all", DATE(2023,1,1), DATE(2024,1,1), "DAILY")
```

Then you download the file as **csv** format.
